# How to make Meat Rocambole - Brazilian Meatloaf

The skewer is derived from a tradition initiated by the cowboys of Brazil. In the last century during the journey of transporting cattle from the west to the south of the country. The cowboys stopped to rest and to the cattle because the trip was long and tiring. To feed themselves, they killed cattle and cut their cuts, which were planned along the way to be taken, and among them the cowboys took turns in the kitchen to help prepare food during the day.

It was from this practice that Churrasco Brasileiros arose, many people brag about the format of how to bake their meats etc. but in the end what everyone wants is that you eat well and be happier. Never confuse this practice with the Barbeque or the cutting of meat as well as how the seasoning is different. Nowadays there is no city in the Brazilian territory that does not have a steakhouse with the same typical flavor from north to south East and a tradition in which Brazil is proud.

Until then, the most prepared type of protein was chicken, ducks, pigs, etc. but cattle came with the advent of exports from the European continent, more precisely from Holland. Today Brazil has its brand even on oxen with the Zebu brand among other mixtures from other countries and our typical Zebu ox from the northern region of the country.

As barbecues are generally more noble cuts of meat, there are always a few small pieces left that are usually at the bottom of the preparation bowls. Based on the principle that in this world nothing is lost, everything is transformed, this theory also applied since it was noble pieces of meat.

Hence the “barbecue” which, despite a small portion, was enough to eat in a short period of time. With that, the trips were faster, starting the “true fast food of Brazil” This is a small story that humbly portrays the adventures and challenges faced by the brave old cowboys of Brazil.
