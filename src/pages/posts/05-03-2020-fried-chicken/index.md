Preparation time: 45 minutes to 1 hour

While the effects of COVID-19 have left a lot of things uncertain, we can still plan and hope for the future. One thing that is around the corner (if not already here) is summer time. And that means, a nice cool beverage while catching some rays outside.

### Ingrediants

- 1lb of deboned chicken
- 1 container of souer cream
- ¼ of tspn of curry powder
- ¼ tspn of black pepper
- 1/2 tspn of salt
- ¼ tspn of paprika
- ¼ tspm dried parsley
- ¼ tspm minced garlic or dried powder
- 2 cups of Flour
- ¼ tspm of curry powder
- 1 lemon

### Instructions

In a bowl, place the chicken pieces and the souwer cream, plus the dried ingredients mix well and move the pieces around to make sure all pieces have been submerged into paste. Set it aside for 30 minutes minimum

In a plate set the flour and all dried ingredients and mix it well with 1 lemon juice. One by one pass the chicken in the flour until all completely coated and set aside. Prepare 1 cup of oil or olive oil and start on high heat on top of the stove. When it is perceived to be heated as needed, start placing the chicken pieces in the sillet and turn it over 4 minutes to each side. Make sure you have a lid for the skillet and reduce the heat to lower heat and cover so that the chicken can cook.

Remove one at the time after all is cooked and put the item in a plate with a paper towel to absorb the oil and serve it hot. It goes well with salads and rice or vegetables.
